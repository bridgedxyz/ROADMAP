you might be asking in the wrong place. project specific questions and proposals cannot be answered here. Please check our [project list](bridged.xyz/github) and double check that your asking in the right place

## 2. Make proposals
Make foundational breaking change proposal for Bridged. We are working very hard to make our tools and foundation concetps general, and for everyone. If you have an idea for better approach, this is the place to appeal and take credit.
