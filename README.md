# ROADMAP
> What we do, when, and what we are aiming for.

Since we do not manage a separate community or a Q&A hub, this is the place for you to ask a general question about Bridged, and make a proposal for new features, or suggest breaking changes to our foundation technologies.

## 0. Note that Bridged is renamed to Grida since July 2021
Learn more about this event on [service migration docs](https://www.notion.so/grida/2021-Q3-Grida-initial-71651f97872a411897b9bbb438b4c671)

## 1. Ask non-project specific questions and Feature request
Create issues for asking general questions and general proposals.

You might be asking in the wrong place. Project-specific questions and proposals cannot be answered here. Please check our project list and double-check that your asking in the right place.

## 2. Make proposals
Make foundational breaking change proposal for Bridged. We are working very hard to make our tools and foundation concepts general and for everyone. If you have an idea for a better approach, this is the place to appeal and take credit.

## 3. Join us on Slack / Reddit ([Slack](https://www.notion.so/bridgedxyz/Bridged-OSS-Community-c6983f668e3e4204aed8856da0e73483) / [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/bridged/))

We highly recommend you to share thoughts on slack with the community before officially making a proposal. If your question or proposal is still valid, you are welcome to open a new issue.

Join us on [Slack](https://www.notion.so/bridgedxyz/Bridged-OSS-Community-c6983f668e3e4204aed8856da0e73483) and have a direct conversation with our core developers!
