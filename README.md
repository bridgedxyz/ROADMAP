# ROADMAP
> What we do, when and what we are aiming.

Since we do not manage separate community or q&a hub, this is the place for you to ask a general question about Bridged, and make a proposal for new features or suggest breaking changes of our foundation technologies

## 1. Ask non project specific questions and Feature request
use Issue for asking general questions, and general proposal.

you might be asking in the wrong place. project specific questions and proposals cannot be answered here. Please check our [project list](bridged.xyz/github) and double check that your asking in the right place

## 2. Make proposals
Make foundational breaking change proposal for Bridged. We are working very hard to make our tools and foundation concetps general, and for everyone. If you have an idea for better approach, this is the place to appeal and take credit.


## 3. Join us on slack / reddit ([slack](https://join.slack.com/t/bridgedxyz/shared_invite/zt-k1ssihl3-9_5GU0upfwPvdzerqLuT1Q) / [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/bridged/))

We hightly recommand you to share thoughts on slack with the community before officially making a proposal. If your question or proposal is still valid, you are welcome to open a new issue
